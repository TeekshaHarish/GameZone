        <h2>How to Play the Card Game</h2>
        <div> 
            <b>1. Objective:</b> The objective of the game is to be the last player with cards remaining.
        </div>
        <div> 
            <b>2. Gameplay:</b>The deck of cards is shuffled and 26 cards are distributed to each player.
            <div>Players take turns playing a card from the top of their deck onto the center pile. To play a card, click the "Play" button.</div>
            <p>If the card played matches the value of the last card placed in the center pile, the player collects all the cards in the center pile. If there is no match, the next player takes their turn.   
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>3. Winning and Losing:</b> The game continues until one player has no cards left in their deck.
            The player with no cards remaining loses the game, and the other player wins. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>4. Modes:</b> The game offers two modes: Two-player and one-player (vs computer).
            In the one-player mode, you play against the computer as your opponent.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>5. Shuffle:</b> The "Shuffle" button allows you to shuffle your deck during the game if you feel you are not getting any good cards.
        </div>
